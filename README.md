# Content-Aware-Video-Cropping
This project implements a content-aware video cropping pipeline using YOLOv8 for object detection and ensures that key objects remain centered in the frame during cropping. The processed video is resized to a target aspect ratio, and audio from the original video is seamlessly integrated into the output.
